            <strong>CTFs</strong> (short for <em>capture the flag</em>) are a type of computer security competition. Contestants are presented with a set of challenges which test their creativity, technical (and AI) skills, and problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories, and when solved, each yields a string (called a <strong>flag</strong>) which is submitted to an online scoring service.

          <p className="leading-relaxed opacity-95">CTFs are a great way to learn a wide array of computer security skills in a safe, legal environment, and are hosted and played by many security groups around the world for fun and practice.</p>
